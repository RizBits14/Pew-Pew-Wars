# Pew-Pew-Wars
A fast-paced 3D shooting game built using Python and PyOpenGL, where the player must shoot down incoming enemies while dodging attacks and surviving as long as possible. The game features player movement, bullet firing, enemy tracking, collision detection, scoring, and a simple game-over system  all rendered in a 3D space.
